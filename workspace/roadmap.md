# Roadmap

You (the Orchestrator) own this file end-to-end. Update it every round
*before* deciding the round's task. The framework reads it back into
your next prompt — it does not parse it, so format it however you find
useful, but follow these conventions so the structure stays legible:

- **Major** items: structural changes expected to move the headline
  performance metric meaningfully (e.g. "Implement EAGLE3 speculative
  decoding", "Add CUDA graphs to verifier decode", "Replace manual
  attention with FlashAttention"). Usually 1-3 rounds each.
- **Minor** items: bug fixes, polish, gates (correctness recoveries,
  tiny kernel swaps, accuracy bumps). Usually 1 round each.
- Use one of these four statuses, and note rounds spent on each
  in-progress item:
  - `todo` — not started.
  - `in_progress` — actively being worked on this round (or recent rounds).
  - `done` — implemented, profiler-verified, hitting (close to) predicted impact.
  - `parked` — implementation is buggy or incomplete, but you believe the
    *direction* is sound. Returnable to `in_progress` later. Use this when
    the metric isn't moving for an *implementation* reason (zero acceptance
    on EAGLE3, capture failures on CUDA graphs, …) rather than a workload
    reason.
  - `abandoned` — the *direction* itself doesn't fit this workload. Strict
    requirement (see below) before flipping to this state.
- For each item include a one-line *why* (predicted impact, what
  bottleneck it addresses).

If any Major item is `todo` or `in_progress`, this round's task should
serve it. Do NOT drop into Minor work while a Major sits unfinished
unless that Minor is genuinely blocking the Major (state the dependency
explicitly when you do).

## `parked` vs `abandoned` — get this distinction right

These two are not the same thing and the loop's behavior degrades if you
treat them as one bucket:

- **`parked`** is the right call when (a) you predicted the technique
  would help, (b) the implementation passes the judge / pytest / accuracy
  gate, but (c) the headline metric didn't move *because the implementation
  appears to have a bug or is incomplete*. Symptoms: zero acceptance on a
  speculative decoder, all-fallback paths on what should be the fast path,
  a CUDA graph capturing but never replaying, etc. The direction itself is
  still believable; you just couldn't make the implementation good enough
  in the rounds you spent. Mark `parked` and move to a different Major;
  return to it when (i) you have a hypothesis for the bug, or (ii) other
  levers are exhausted.

- **`abandoned`** is the right call only when the *direction itself* is
  the wrong fit for this workload. Examples: continuous batching on a
  workload contractually limited to single-batch, MTP on a model that
  doesn't ship MTP heads, paged attention when the engine's fixed-shape
  KV path is already optimal at this batch size. Each requires a
  *mechanism-level* autopsy explaining why the technique cannot help
  *here* (not "it didn't pay off in 3 rounds"). If you can't write that
  mechanism, the right status is `parked`, not `abandoned`.

**Hard rule for `abandoned` autopsies:** you must name a code-level or
hardware-level mechanism — not a behavioral observation. A perf number
("+0% TPOT") is not a mechanism; "the workload is single-batch by
contract so continuous batching cannot raise arithmetic intensity" is.
If acceptance on a speculative decoder is zero, that is *not* a reason
to abandon — it's a debugging task, and the right status is `parked`
with a hypothesis. Spec decode acceptance debugging has a checklist in
`references/algorithms/speculative-decoding.md` ("Debugging 0
acceptance"); read it before parking or abandoning.

## Major

- [in_progress] M1: Shard MPSC producer state and move arbitration to the single consumer
  (round 1). Reduce contention from the global queue mutex while retaining exact
  minimum-priority behavior and bounded accounting.
- [todo] M2: Replace per-enqueue heap allocation with bounded reusable value storage.
  Address allocator cost and cache churn, especially for the fixed-size benchmark payloads.
- [todo] M3: Tune the bounded-capacity and synchronization layout after M1/M2.
  Reduce atomics, false sharing, and scan overhead using benchmark evidence without weakening
  linearizability.
- [todo] M4: Add workload-shape specializations and validate end-to-end throughput.
  Focus on the trusted MPSC benchmark while keeping the complete ABI and non-MPSC scenarios
  correct.
